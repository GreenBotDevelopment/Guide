# Permissions

Before starting, not that you can re-invite the bot to your server with the admin permissions to fix it ( You don't need to kick the bot ).\
[https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=783708073390112830\&scope=bot\&permissions=19456](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=783708073390112830\&scope=bot\&permissions=19456)\
If you don't want to do that, it doesn't matter.

### 1. Edit the permissions of the channel

Click on the edit button behind your voice channel
